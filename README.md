# Google Drive Direct Download Link Generator

This Python script generates direct download links for files hosted on Google Drive. It makes use of the Google Drive API to retrieve the file ID and generate a URL that can be used to download the file directly, bypassing the Google Drive web interface.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the script in your favorite Python IDE or text editor.
3. Make sure your file's visibility in Google Drive is set to "Anyone with the link".
4. Copy the sharing URL for your file.
5. Run the script and paste the sharing URL when prompted.
6. The script will generate a direct download link for your file and display it on the console.
7. If you want to download the file right away, type 'Y' when prompted. Otherwise, type 'N'.
